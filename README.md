## Pokemon React app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This aim of this project is to practice fetching data and presenting it on screen.
This project searches for a single Pokemon and displays information for this Pokemon on screen.
This was copied from the original repository created during my time at Northcoders.

To run the project type 'npm start'
